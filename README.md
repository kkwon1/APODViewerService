# APOD Viewer Service

The back-end service for my APOD Viewer project. It is written in golang with mongoDB for data persistence. NASA's APOD can be found [here](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html).

The front-end React app can be found [here](https://github.com/kkwon1/APODViewer).

The back-end service is responsible for serving the front-end app with APOD images, allowing users to search, like and save, and communicating with the NASA API.
